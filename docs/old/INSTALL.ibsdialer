IBSDialer will look for "server.ibs" after connecting.
So you have to setup named to map "server.ibs" to
ibs server address.

IBSDialer uses "http://server.ibs/dialer/

If  you are using multiport, you have to modify portslave
to send corresponding error codes to IBSDialer.
(see /portslave/ibs.patch)
