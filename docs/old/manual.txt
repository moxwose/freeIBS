I. Concepts

    A. Introduction

	IBS(ISP Billing System) is a free and open-source project, released
	under GPL license that provides accounting services for ISPs that
	sell Prepaid VoIP/DialUP/Lan accounts. It also supports VoIP Call
	Detail Recording with radius accounting.
	
	Web interface has been written in PHP4 and the core has been written
	in Python. IBS uses Postgresql as database . IBS can work with 
	Cisco Routers/Access servers, Multiport (needs portslave) for dialup 
	connections, Cisco and Quintum Products for VoIP Call Detail Recording. 
	
	IBS supports LAN accounting using PPTP protocol (needs POPTOP),
	PrePaid VoIP with IVR for cisco/quintum platforms, Traffic Shaping 
	for LAN clients, Integrated Mail System(needs Qmail and Courier IMAP) 
	and an apache authentication module (needs mod_auth_external).
	
	IBS implements a thread pool, an event scheduler and a database
	connection pool for better performance. The core is providing all
	information to clients by a TCP connection. Interface uses this
	connection to query information from IBS server. 
    
    
    B. Groups and Rules
	
	IBS Groups are charging methods that define how much credit will
	be consumed by logged on users based on Time of day/Day of week
	and called number prefix (VoIP only). There can be infinite number
	of groups each with different Charge Per Minutes.
	
	IBS supports different definable charging methods for different
	users. For each type of connection, you can specify a charging
	method for any user. You do that by putting that user in a
	Charging Group( or Group ).
	
	Each charging group contain some Charge Rules. Each charge rule
	should have a day of week, an start time and end time, and a
	CPM(charge per minute) for this period(internet groups) or a 
	charge list(for VoIP groups).
	
	Charge Lists (for VoIP), specify a call destination based charging
	method. A charge list is a list of country codes and their CPMs
	(Charge Per Minute).
	
	Currently IBS only supports time-based charging rules. In furture IBS 
	will support transfer based and mixed charging rules.
	
	
    C. Permissions
	
	IBS has a flexible permission based authorization for admins.
	Each admin is permitted to do a job only if he has been given
	related permissions.
	
	There is only one exceptional permission:  "Admin - GOD"
	This permission means all possible positive permissions.
	Giving this single permission to an admin means giving him
	all permissions to do all tasks in IBS.
	
	Some permissions are more configurable. They can be assigned
	value(s). For example "Admin - Limit Login Address", can be
	assigned multiple IP addresses, which will limit from which
	IPs an admin can login to IBS Web Interface.
	Some other permissions are designed for resellers. Resellers
	are admins who have control over limited number of users,
	which are owned by them (Every user has an owner as you can 
	see in User Information Page). This type of permissions like
	"Internet - Change users information", can be assigned to
	one of these two values: "All" or "Restricted".
	Assigning "Restricted" means this admin has the permission to
	change information only for users whose owners are that admin.
	But, "All" means this admin can change information of ALL users.
	
	
	
II. Interface Sections

    A. Internet Users
    
	1. Add New User
	
	    To add new internet users. In this page you can specify
	    following items( just mandatory fields are explained):
	    
	    Username 	: username of the user.
	    Password 	: guess what!
	    Day limit	: limits day usage of the user, so users cannot
			  exceed this limit in a single day. (-1 means unlimited)
	    Credit	: Initial credit of the user
	    Exp. Date	: User expiration date. This day is an absolute
			  date, this means even if the user never logs
			  into the system, the account will expire on
			  the specified date. IBS uses this date to delete
			  accounts which have expired more than six months
			  ago.
	    Rel. Exp. Date: Relative Expiration Date. This expiration date
			  is relative to the first login of the user.
	    Owner	: Owner of the user. Used for reseller permissions.
	    
	    
	    After filling out above fields, you must select in which types
	    the user can login to the system. For each type, you have to
	    select charge group.
			  
			  
	2. Generate Users
	
	    User generation is a process in which many users with
	    the same attributes can be created. Most fields in this
	    page are similar to Add New User page. The difference is in
	    how the username and passwords are created.
	    Each username is built up of three parts:
		    Prefix + Digits + (Postfix)
	    Prefix is an string which all users will start with.
	    Digits are incremented for each new user, you specify
	    how many digits should be used in "Serial Digits Count",
	    numbers will be left padded with 0 if needed. "Start"
	    specifies the start of counting, and count specifies how
	    many users should be generated.
	    Postfix is like Prefix, but it's just added to the end of
	    the username and is optional.
	    You can also specify how passwords should be generated,
	    if you want password to only contain digits, you can select
	    it. Otherwise let it unchanged.
	    
	    For example:
		Prefix = 'usr'
		Serial Digits Count = '4'
		Postfix = ''
		Password Characters Count: '5'
		Password Characters Type: 'Digits Only'
		Start = 10
		Count = 4
		
		These settings will create 4 users like this:
		
		  | Username | Password
		=======================
		1 | usr0010  | 61238
		2 | usr0011  | 29745
		3 | usr0012  | 82352
		4 | usr0013  | 90648
		
	    After you hit "Generate" button , A list of users which will be
	    generated is shown. Then by clicking apply generation those users
	    will be generated.
		
	3. User Generations List
	    
	    Previously generated users list. You can see usernames
	    and passwords by selecting a generation from table.
	
		
	4. User Information
	
	    Most of fields here are explained in Add New User page.
	    Just two concepts here : every user has two important logs.
	    Connection Log and Credit Log, they both can be viewed in
	    User Report link in this page. Connection Log shows credit
	    which is decremented by the system when the user was online,
	    and Credit log which shows when and how much the credit has
	    been added to the user. When you add credit to a user, you
	    can enter how much money he has paid. The system tracks
	    paid money and credit increments, and calculates how much user
	    has to pay: the user "Due".

	    At the bottom of this page, there is a table that can be
	    used to see how much the user can stay online if the shown
	    rule is used.
	    
	    a. Edit Info
	    
		Change User Information.

	
	    b. Change Credit
		
		Add credit to the user, or add information about paid
		money in this page.

	    
	    c. Change Password
	    
		Change user password.
	
		
	    d. Check Password
	    
		IBS doesn't save passwords as clear text. So if you needed
		to know if user's password is correct, you can test it in this
		page.
		
		
	    e. Lock This User
	    
		In this page you can lock the user. A user can have
		more than one locks, each lock can have a reason.
		A locked user cannot login to the system.
	    
	    
	    f. Delete User
	    
		Delete a user from system.
		
		WARNING: Deleting a user will also delete all his logs,
			 so it's better to just lock the user if you are
			 unsure if you need the logs or not.
		
		
	    g. User Report
	    
		Credit Log and Connection Log can be viewed here.
		Disconnect reason shows why and how a user had beed disconnected.
		See (Internet - User Information) for more information
		about Credit Log and Connection Log.
		
		
	5. Users List
		
	    In this page you can have a very datailed search for a user.
	    You can select from many conditions in this page to find
	    a user with least information you may have about him.
	
		
	6. Set MOTD
	
	    (IBSDialer users only) Set Message Of The Day. For users who
    	    use IBSDialer to connect.
		
		Message Title	:  This text will pop up on user's desktop,
			    	   as the user logs in using IBSDialer.
				
		Contents	:  If the user clicks on popped up message,
				   a browser window will open and the "Contents"
				   will be shown to the user.
	
	
	
    B. VoIP Users
    
	1. Add New User
	    
	    (See Internet - Add New User)
	    The only important thing here is that usernames
	    should only contain digits. No alphabets.
	    And they can only be 8 digits.
	
		
	2. Generate Users
	
	    (See Internet - Generate Users)
	    For VoIP users, passwords can only contain digits, and its
	    length can only be 4.
	
	    
	3. User Generations List
	    
	    (See Internet - Generations List)
	
	
	4. User Information

	    b. Change Credit
	    c. Change Password
	    d. Change Password
	    e. Lock This User
	    f. Delete User

	5. Users List

	    (See Internet - Users List)
	
    C. Groups
    
	1. Internet Add Group
	
	    Here you can make new groups. Notice if you specify
	    "No Limit" for group type, then users in this group
	    can always login to the system anytime, and rules
	    you define won't take effect.
	    "Timely Internet User" is the usual group type for
	    normal users.
	    
	    Checking "Group is visible to all admins" makes the group
	    visible to all admins by default, and not checking it
	    will makes the group visible to Admins who are granted
	    access to (by adding group name to 
	    "Groups - Can list these Groups even if they are non-visible"
	    permission values).
	    
	    
	2. Internet Groups List
	
	    List of internet groups. You can click on "List Group Rules" here
	    to add/delete/modify group rules.
	    
	    
	    a. Rules List
		
		List of group rules and their information
		
		
	    b. Add New Rule
	    
		To add a new rule, you have to specify on which days,
		from Rule Start time till Rule End time,  users in
		this group will be charged at amount of CPM(Cost Per Minute) 
		for each minute of being online.
		
		Rule Usage Limit specifies how long a user can use this
		rule. For example think of a situation where you want
		a user to connect for maximum of 1 hours between 8 AM
		and 10 AM. We will create a rule starting @8 AM and
		ending @10AM and enter "60" (minutes) in Rule Usage Limit
		field.
			
	    
	3. VoIP Add Group
	
	    (See Groups - Internet Add Group)
		
		
	4. VoIP Groups List

	    (See Groups - Internet Groups List)

		(See Groups - Internet Groups List - Rules List)
		
		
	    b. Add New Rule
		
		(See Groups - Internet Groups List - Rules List)
		The only difference is that instead of CPM( cost
		per minute), you have to specify Rule Charging
		Group, in which country codes and their CPMs
		are defined.
	    

	5. VoIP Countries List
	
		List of all countries,and their country prefix code,
		just to make it easier to add the country into a 
		VoIP Charge List.
		
		
	6. VoIP Charges List

		A newly created admin won't have any permissions, so 
		you have to add needed permissions after you create 
		an admin.
		
	2. Delete Admin
	
		To Delete an admin.
		
		WARNING: Deleting an admin will also delete all his
			 logs. So it's better to lock the admin if you
			 are unsure if you will need his logs.
			 
			 
	3. Change Password
		
		To change an admin password. If you have enough access,
		a list will appear and you can select for which admin you

	5. Admin Information
	
		Views information about an admin. Admins have two important
		reports. Deposit Report and Credit Usage Report, both can be viewed
		in "Admin Report" page. Each admin has an "Deposit Ratio" value.
		This value specifies discount for that admin. For example
		suppose an admin whose "Deposit Ratio" is 10%, when you give
		him 1000 more deposit, he can spend 1000 + 10% * 1000 = 1100.
		
		
		a. Edit Info

		You have to define all rases you want ibs users to login 
		on or ibs to controll.
		You must specify the right ras type and "Radius Secret Key" 
		and "Snmp Community" if applicable.
		(See docs/INSTALL.<ras type>)
	    
	    b. List Ports
		
		Lists all ports on this ras, you can add new ports to ras
		using "Add New Port"
		There are 3 port types:
		    -"Async" for internet dialup ports
		    -"Voice" for VoIP origination ports
		    -"Voice-termination" for VoIP termination ports
		
		To see "* Ports graphs" correctly, you must define ports and
		their types here.

III. Troubleshooting

	IBS has extensive options for debugging and locating problems. IBS saves
	its log files in '/var/log/ibs' by default. IBS core appends its logs
	to 'ibs.log', and Web Interface	uses 'ibs_interface.log'.
	You can change its core log level in 'defs.py'.
	
	On user login failure, one of important places to look for the cause
	is "User Report". For each disconnection, the "Disconnect Reason"
	is shown in this log.
