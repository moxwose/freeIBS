=====================================================================
- onlines list for each ras

- assign a name to each ras and show it instead of/with ip address

- show page x of n in reports

- Documentation!!!

- All reports start/end date fix

  we have now conditions for login and logout time in reports. this doesn't satisfy users and also
  logout time conditions are unnecessary. it must be login_from and login_to conditions meaning users that logged on
  after login_from and before login_to
  
- New GROUPs based on ras ip/ports with ability to dedicate lines for special users

- action on group of users.. (define a group of users)

- discount support!

- A settable flag that don't let users login

- assign/authorize ip's allow admins to set a specific ip for a user

- IBS SERVER PASSWORD CHECKING ISSUES
    -for non local clients,it's better to add a handler to get password salt of a username, and then get encrypted pass
    -we currently keep passwords in session, it's insecure! it's md5 hash, but as long as we accept md5 hashes 
     every user that can read session files (owner is apache, ex. other webbased apps) can use it to login to ibs_server


- IBS SERVER REMOTE_ADDR ISSUES
    -It's insecure now! we must not trust remote_addr if our peer address is not 127.0.0.1.
     if our peer address is not  127.0.0.1 we must use peer address as remote address

- admin expiration date

- virtual isp

- check pass for admins

- focus on forms on page load

- transactionize useradd creditadd and such things

- VoIP check onlines for cisco routers using "show aaa users all" command and rsh or update accountings

- NEXT GENERATION IBS
  
  there are users recognizes by and integer called user_id
  there are some services each user can have (lan, dialup, voip , ....)
  it's like users have some kind of permissions. each permission has it's own value(s)
  for example group each service uses, or other service specific information
  we need a good group for this!

  pluginized ibs / every service must be plugin and there must be well placed hooks
  Assign ip's
  dedicate ports
  VISP
  transactioize
  group of users
  password handshaking
  
- Patch poptop to send real remote ip address in radius request so we can use it as port in ibs

- Templates for web interface

- Making Logout time sync on all methods. This prevent from contradiction in reports/user credit.
