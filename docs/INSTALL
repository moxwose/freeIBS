II. Extracting
    Extract the bz2 tarbal in /usr/local/. A sample Command can be

III. Change pg_hba.conf
    You should allow IBSng to connect postgresql database. It's done by changing pg_hba.conf located in
    normally in /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf.
    
    For example, if database and ibs are on same box and you want to allow everyone on localhost to
    connect to IBSng database without password, put this line on --TOP-- of pg_hba.conf.
    
    local  IBSng   ibs            trust
    
    You must restart postgresql service after changing pg_hba.conf.(ex. service postgresql restart)
    
    NOTE: if /var/lib/pgsql directory is empty, try starting postgresql service, and it will
	  initialize database.
