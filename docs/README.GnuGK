It's currently only support RadAuth, and needs H.235 Tokens. Also login 
from multiple usernames isn't support yet, while it's not impossible from design point.

IBSng doesn't use update accounting packets from gnugk yet, but this may change
in future.

A sample configuration can be found via /usr/local/IBSng/addons/gnugk/gnugk.ini
I've tested this with openphone and ohphone and it works.
