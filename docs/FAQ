TECHNICAL

1. Can IBSng interface run in php 5?
    No, because of some naming conflicts.
    It's matter of renaming some of functions.

2. I can't See User Search when I select high RPPs.
    First Check that it isn't php memory limitation,
    Raise memory_limit in php.ini (40M should be enough). 
    User Search Page is slow on large lists because of smarty and php slowness. Many
    If conditions inside templates causes user search to be cpu intensive.
